        <p>Hey there my name is Alexander Schaper (Alex is fine), and I’ve created this website to tell you a little about myself and what I hope to achieve in my studies here!</p>

        <p>I am 22 years old and recently moved to Heathmont east of Melbourne for work reasons. I work at a go karting center part-time and love it there! I am now studying at RMIT doing some of the Bachelor of IT classes. Fun fact, I used to box when I was younger!</p>

        <p>The reason I study IT is because I have always had a passion in technology, from all the crazy things it can do like create these wonderful pieces of art, give people a platform to talk about issues to a wide audience to even helping people regain control in their bodies! Most of my IT experiences come from games, and I have a bit of experience doing some HTML and CSS, only light though.</p>

        <p>I chose to study at RMIT because it just seemed the most accessible and recommended to me. A few friends I have study on campus and love it which made me want to do it. Though due to work commitments and travel I chose to study online instead through Open Universities Australia, and am enjoying it so far!</p>

        <p>I expect to learn a multitude of things from my studies such as learning about the effects of technology on society and the people, programming and even how to land a job in the industry. Programming is what I’m looking forward to the most as I love to see lines of text come together and create interactable programs that entertain people.</p>

        <p>Below are some links to what I would like my ideal job to be, some personality tests, and even a project I’ve whipped up! Thank you for reading and enjoy your stay.</p>

        <p id="center">I've taken a few personality tests and here I reflect on what they say about me and how I would work around them regarding team work.  </p>

        <h4 id="h"><a href="project.html">Project Idea</a></h4>
        <p style="text-align:center;">I have thought of a game idea in which it would help people learn to do basic coding so that they can be comfortable with the idea.</p>
